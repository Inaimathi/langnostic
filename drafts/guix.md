So I've been looking into [`guix`](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/)[^which-im-convinced], and it looks like it's basically everything I've ever wanted in a package manager.

[^which-im-convinced]: Which I'm convinced is pronounced "geeks" for reasons I'm not entirely clear on. I read it somewhere but haven't confirmed yet, so I dunno; maybe it's complete horseshit?

It's like [`nix`](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/) in the sense of reproducible builds and immutable package store, but it uses [`guile` Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) as the [package definition](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Defining-Packages.html#Defining-Packages) language instead of some godawful, [ad-hoc frankensteining of Haskell, Perl and Javascript](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-constructs). It also has a coherent distribution story, whether you're looking to distribute sofware to people [who also use `guix`](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-copy.html#Invoking-guix-copy), or those [who don't](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-pack.html#Invoking-guix-pack). The [resulting builds](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/2018/tarballs-the-ultimate-container-image-format/) can be reproducible, and can be formatted as tarballs or Docker images. This makes `guix` a decent candidate for general dev-ops needs, and I'm going to seriously consider doing something about this at my company.

My life's kind of upside-down at the moment, for reasons I may or may not end up ultimately blogging about, but when I finally scrape some time together, my plan is to replace `nix` in my [`machine-setup` scripts](https://github.com/inaimathi/machine-setup), start deploying [my blog](https://github.com/inaimathi/langnostic) using those packaging facilities I mentioned, and look into the possibility of using `guix` as a package manager for Standard ML. It looks like this would involve submitting pull requests to [`packages/sml.scm`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/sml.scm?id=v1.0.1-114-g0dc8c9088f) that mirror the [`packages/python-xyz.scm`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/python-xyz.scm?id=v1.0.1-114-g0dc8c9088f) implementations of things. Except, you know, for SML rather than Python.

In other news, [PolyHack TO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9B7dw_i7Qn7iumwhm46cQQ) finally posted [my talk from last June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toERI0yDY1g). This is a shortened version of my Clojure North talk about stupid web games, so you can now get kind of an idea of how it would have gone without the massive, mid-talk flaming explosion. It's mildly surreal to see this talk up right now, because while its' only been a year, my life has taken enough weird turns that it feels more like ten. The Clojure North talk will not be coming to you in a neatly polished, YouTube-published video, but I may eventually post the raw audio/video somewhere for posterity.

As ever, I'll let you know how it all goes.
