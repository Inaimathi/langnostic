So...

1. No, rice flower is just not a thing here. You might use it as a 10% ingredient in the wrap mix, but no more than that. The wrappers otherwise get all crumbly and crackly.
2. Spinach, green onions, carrots and mushrooms are fucking amazing fillings. Also, tempeh works as the protein. I'm going to try the next batch with tilapia and report back.
3. They stick together pretty easily when frozen, although this might have been an effect of the low-gluten wrappers.
4. Steaming them on cabbage leaves is nice and hipster and all, but I need to do a price comparison between cabbage heads and parchament paper before deciding how to proceed long-term
