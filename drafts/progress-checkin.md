This is just a touchstone to talk about a few things I've gotten done that I didn't note elsewhere.

## `clj`

- added set operations
- added Python3-style string templating syntax

## `quickproject`

- new testing template

## `house`

- major overhaul complete
- possibly &rest params, and simpler `define-file-handler`?
