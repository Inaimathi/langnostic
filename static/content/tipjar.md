# TipJar

So. You've read a bunch of my crazy-ass ramblings, and you feel a compulsion to throw spare change at me.

Well, don't worry about it.

I'm a gainfully employed Toronto programmer, whose writing is crafted for the dual purposes of a log stream and my own amusement. You've paid me quite enough by reading. If that's really not good enough, and you feel the need to engage in reciprocation...

### Discuss

Submit my posts to the appropriate content aggregators and comment on them. I won't tell you which posts or aggregators, but pick out whatever you find interesting enough to discuss and discuss it.

### Tip these folks

The [EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate), the [FSF](https://my.fsf.org/donate/), and [a choice piece of Lisp infrastructure](https://www.quicklisp.org/donations.html) all do good, necessary work, _and_ could probably put your money to better use than I would.

### Feed My Habits

I use a couple of services that provide subscription bonuses.

Specifically, [Digital Ocean](www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=445ca16e1a76) and [Ritual](http://invite.ritual.co/LEO4857). So if you're considering signing up for one or both, click [here](www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=445ca16e1a76) or [here](http://invite.ritual.co/LEO4857) to give both of us a free kick.
