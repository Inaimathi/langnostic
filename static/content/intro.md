Welcome to Language Agnostic, the blog of [Inaimathi](https://github.com/Inaimathi)! It's now built on top of the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) framework [`Spock`](https://www.spock.li/). I'm reasonably confident it's no longer the least performant blog on the internet.

Enjoy the various programming-themed writings availble on offer. The latest post is available below and the archive link is directly above this text.
