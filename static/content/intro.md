Welcome to Language Agnostic, the blog of [Inaimathi](https://github.com/Inaimathi)! Because it's now built on top of [Go](http://golang.org/), complete with [fantastic web server](https://github.com/fukamachi/woo#how-fast), it might no longer be the least performant blog on the internet.

Enjoy the various programming-themed writings availble on offer. The latest post is available below and the archive link is directly above this text.
