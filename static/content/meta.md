## About Me

I'm a Graphic Designer (graduated from OCAD with a bachelor's)specializing in illustration and web development. Also, I like programming, and learning languages. Which is why I'm here.

Currently, I'm working as a Common Lisp developer at the Moneris point of sale R&D team.

## About This Site

This site was built out of parentheses and adrenaline. The site itself is about 300 lines of fairly readable Common Lisp. The "database" is a simple [triple-store](https://github.com/Inaimathi/fact-base) implemented in another ~400 lines of the same, and the web server is a [minimal, asynchronous system](https://github.com/Inaimathi/house) put together in yet another ~800 lines of CL.
