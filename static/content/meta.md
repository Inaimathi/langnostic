## About Me

I'm a "Graphic Designer" (graduated from [OCAD](http://www.ocadu.ca/) with a bachelor's) specializing in illustration and web development. Also, I like programming, and learning languages. Which is why I'm here.

Currently, I'm working as a Ruby/Go developer as part of [500px](https://500px.com).

## About This Site

This site was built out of bytes and adrenaline. The site itself is about 350 lines of fairly readable Go, which I still plan to refine over the course of a few weeks or months. There is no database any more, I'm just storing `md` files on disk and serving them to you when you ask, and I'm using the default [Go server](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) to do all the fancy `http` crap.
