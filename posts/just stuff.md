I can't really define today's entry, so I won't try to.

Lots of things are going through my head right now, and I'd like to get on with my work, so it seems like it'd be better to nail a few of them down before they take over.

Firstly, it seems like the pace at work keeps accelerating no matter what. I'm granted a reprieve because it's become mind-bogglingly obvious that I produce better results when I'm given time to think things out and focus, but everyone else at the office (from the customer service people to the finance guys) are all sprinting at full-tilt-and-a-half.

This is not a compliment, by the way.

I'm not saying they do good work at that speed, just that they have to keep it up. The cracks are starting to show. Our network admin now literally spends most of his time troubleshooting blackberries and building machines (as opposed to maintaining the production servers, which is supposed to be his main job). Developers are stuck sourcing office supplies at ridiculously low cost because we don't have a purchasing department to do the work (I guess this saves money somewhere? I dunno). Marketing spends all of their time on the phone, being reactive or (with increasing frequency) subjecting the rest of the company to some survey or another for the purposes of winning an award for excellence in the area of "lying about how you treat your employees". I wish they'd cut that second one altogether, but it also seems like they should be concentrating on the company's corporate image rather than the minutia, especially if we need to attract $70+ million of new business by next year.

Hell, maybe this is just what the transition feels like, but it seems ridiculous. We could ironically be doing more work better, by *slowing down*. "The Transition" refers to company size. You see this is the first company I've been at where the situation is a switch in gears from 20 people to 100+. Every other place I've worked has either been a ~4-man shop (and proud of it) or they already had multiple hundreds of employees. The switch is painful if this is it.
