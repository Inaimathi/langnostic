This is a long-delayed addition to the logo bar. I was thinking about it the other day and realized that I'd actually done more work in each of [ML](http://sml-family.org/) and [Go](http://golang.org/) than in [Rebol](http://www.rebol.com/rebol3/) and [Smalltalk](http://pharo.org/) combined. And while I haven't yet done *more* ML/Go work than PHP, I'm certainly much more proud of it. So obviously, those languages should be represented in the title. It's getting a bit wide now though; I might need to re-think the layout of the site header before too long.

This concludes the preceding message.
