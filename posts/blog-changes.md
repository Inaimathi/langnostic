So I've spent some time putting together a change or two in this blogs' back-end. You shouldn't see *much* of a change from your perspective, apart from the hopefully obvious cosmetic update. In terms of functionaity, I now use [`higlight.js`](https://highlightjs.org/) instead of doing highlighting manually at article write-time. Secondly, tags in the [archive section](/archive) are now at the bottom of the page rather than at the top *(And I reserve the right to move them around some more. Specifically, I'm considering a two-column layout)*. And thirdly, you can now follow the [atom feed](/feed/atom) by a [specific tag](/feed/atom/by-tag/common-lisp) *(The tag doesn't have to be `common-lisp`, I'm just using that for illustrative purposes)*.

On the back-end, pretty much everything has been uprooted. As you'll hopefully be able to see in [this repo](https://github.com/Inaimathi/langnostic). The new version is written in `go`, and basically just serves up static `.md` files transformed to HTML. I'm going to see what I can do about putting together a semi-smart caching system, and [this](https://github.com/Inaimathi/langnostic/blob/3b3dd733542d45212084fb81c6b4ca04bb42ca09/handlers.go#L103-L107) seems like the easiest place to graft it.

This has been a while coming, and is one of the reasons I've been on the silent side lately. I *was* going to talk more about it now, but I've just realized what time it is, so I'm getting the fuck to bed. Further updates coming shortly.
