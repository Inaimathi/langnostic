I just got

through my company book-order (I also got [The Reasoned Schemer](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10663), but I want to finish the first one before I move on).

It's at once an exercise book for Scheme/CL, and the gentlest introduction to recursive programming I've seen. I'm already fairly comfortable with both, so this is really just a refresher for me, but I could see someone new to functional programming (or programming in general) getting some serious mileage out of the text.

If you fit that description and are interested, [the](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992) [Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/Seasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/026256100X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b) [Trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/Reasoned-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262562146/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_c) is easily worth the $70 Amazon is charging.

> EDIT: Ok, wow. I figured I'd breeze through this, given my experience with Scheme and recursion, but 5 chapters in, it's getting pretty interesting. It's obvious that my model of recursion was incomplete if not outright broken earlier, but dammit, I'm progressing. In any case, my point is: even if you think you're fairly familiar with Scheme, consider picking these up.
