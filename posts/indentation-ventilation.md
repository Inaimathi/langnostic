I need to vent, so just ignore this article.

[Your](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10381438/lisp-removing-an-element-from-a-list-with-nested-lists) formatting [makes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10220939/clisp-reversing-a-simple-list) me [want](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10368407/emacs-syntax-highlighting-of-nested-regular-expressions) to [puke](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10304726/how-would-one-merge-two-strings-that-are-ordered-alphabetically-in-lisp-using-re).

For fuck's sake, when I ask questions about JavaScript or C, I don't bust out

```javascript
lorem ipsum(dolor, sit) { 
    amet = consectetur(); 
    adipiscing (elit) {
        Nulla_quis_purus = ac;
        arcu = consequat(consectetur(vitae(convallis,lacus)));}
    Aliquam { erat volutpat;}}
```

It's not as though it's difficult. Lisp is made of s-expressions, the only places where indentation gets ambiguous is in [extended `loop` forms](https://github.com/slyrus/cl-typesetting/blob/master/tables.lisp#L168), and maybe one or two edge cases with `let`s. Just take the three minutes required to read the [standard style](http://dept-info.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~idurand/enseignement/PFS/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/indentation.html), and stop pretending that you're showing us paren-using noble savages the proper way to waste vertical space.

**Fuck!**

I need some sleep.
