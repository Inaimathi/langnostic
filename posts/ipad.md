So.

Yeah.

I'm not getting one yet. I'll probably pick up 2.0. Definitely thinkin' about it. Here's the thing though; yes it 'starts at $499', but the [cheapest version](http://www.apple.com/ipad/pricing/) that's any good at all is actually $730. At that price point, it has some [very](http://phones.verizonwireless.com/motorola/droid/) [tough](http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/hp-mini-1000/4505-3121_7-33351192.html) competition even discounting [the](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015T963C/?tag=gocous-20&hvadid=4139612357&ref=pd_sl_19cagz43um_e) [obvious](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/).

Yes, it has an edge on the kindle in the fact that it reads standard PDFs (which has [legitimate](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) [uses](http://www.emacs.uniyar.ac.ru/doc/O'Reilly_Emacs/Writing%20GNU%20Emacs%20Extensions.PDF)), but the price point means that people who would buy kindles will probably pass on this thing.

The problem I've got actually has more to do with those first two links I posted. If you're looking for a mobile platform (and don't already own an iPhone), the Droid actually outclasses the iPad in terms of performance. I submit that that is ridiculous. Even if it weren't for Google's little machine, though, if I want to pull out a PDF on the subway and read the thing, my HP Mini performs admirably. It also has a faster processor, probably more ram (I defy you to find a memory spec on their tech page) and a bigger hard-drive, along with Bluetooth and wireless networking. If I were to spring for the $700 iPad, it would have 3G (which I  would need a data plan for, at which point I can go out and [buy a pretty good replacement](http://your.rogers.com/Business/productsservices/wireless/servicesaddons/pccards.asp?&cm_mmc=grdrt-_-all-_-en-_-stick)).

I don't need the thing, but it's got me pissed off because it's soooo close to making me whip my money out. If it had slightly beefier specs, flash support, and two or three USB ports, I'd be in line right now (I'd also probably pick up [a](http://www.audioholics.com/reviews/cables/trulink) [couple](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC184LL/A?fnode=MTY1NDA1Mg&mco=MTMzNzg5MDM) of things to go with it too). 

It's a very odd move by Apple, I've got to say. This thing is between a phone and a netbook in performance, but it's up at laptop range in terms of price. The only explanation I can think of is that Jobs is trying to market this directly to the "computer as fashion item" crowd. Which I guess isn't very odd for Apple at all...
