I'm still alive, just so you know.

### <a name="lisp-contest" href="#lisp-contest"></a>LISP Contest

The past little while has seen me refine my entry to [the Lisp In Summer Projects contest](http://lispinsummerprojects.org/). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/Inaimathi/deal), in case you'd like to keep an eye on progress, but it's not playable yet, and I don't want to talk about it until I've at least ironed out some of the big questions. Don't worry, I'm keeping a journal, so you'll see all the gory details rather than just a finished product, but I want to *have* a product before I show it off. On a related note, I've been told that there's a local [Bento](https://bentomiso.com/)-based group called [Games With Friends](https://bentomiso.com/events/51e01b0fa5a6277896000000) that regularly tests tabletop card and board games in meatspace. I'm seriously considering dropping by, both before and after I get a working system together.

### <a name="work" href="#work"></a>Work

I've started my new job, and it's fun so far. On a scale of `1` to `10`, the levels of paranoia and bureaucracy here are `Dilbert`, and apparently that's all I'll be able to tell you. Not that I ever blogged about the actual systems I was working on at my old job, but we're going to be doing some *very* interesting things here<a name="note-Thu-Jul-18-194952EDT-2013"></a>[|1|](#foot-Thu-Jul-18-194952EDT-2013) and I was looking forward to being able to talk about them. I won't though; anything past what I've already said could compromise some of my employers' IP, or at least run a significant risk of doing so, and no offense, but that risk isn't worth it for the sake of a hobby blog. So that's that.

- We're doing R&D work
- It involves embedded systems
- It's very interesting
- Lots of the locals are severely, sometimes paralyzingly, paranoid about security
- It's sometimes necessary to requisition a requisition-form-requisition form

...and you won't hear anything else about what I'm working on *at* work until I start working somewhere else.

### <a name="fiction" href="#fiction"></a>Fiction

I just finished reading [Neptune's Brood](http://www.amazon.ca/Neptunes-Brood-Charles-Stross/dp/0425256774) by [Charlie Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/), which can best be thumbnailed as "Accountants In Spaaaaace!", and it was an excellent read. [This](http://www.orbitbooks.net/2013/07/05/charles-stross-on-exoplanetography-designing-planets/) is the sort of stuff I go to Stross for; not the usual Star-Wars-esque naval battles in 3 dimensions, but a hard look at what space battles would actually look like in the absence of hand-waivium and plottite. I'm not sure how sympathetic the characters are since I'm a lousy judge of these things<a name="note-Thu-Jul-18-195044EDT-2013"></a>[|2|](#foot-Thu-Jul-18-195044EDT-2013), but the world and in particular its finance system is constructed in such a way as to make space-colonization by humans<a name="note-Thu-Jul-18-195055EDT-2013"></a>[|3|](#foot-Thu-Jul-18-195055EDT-2013) plausible both in the physics and economics senses. The societal implications about our deep future are less than encouraging, but I don't want to spoiler any part of this before anyone reading this has likely gotten a chance to read [it](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/07/book-review-neptunes-brood-charles-stross). I got the hard-back through an Amazon pre-order, but you can probably walk into your local Chapters and just pick up a fresh one by this point.

##### Footnotes

1 - <a name="foot-Thu-Jul-18-194952EDT-2013"></a>[|back|](#note-Thu-Jul-18-194952EDT-2013) - Well, by my definition of "very" and "interesting" at any rate.

2 - <a name="foot-Thu-Jul-18-195044EDT-2013"></a>[|back|](#note-Thu-Jul-18-195044EDT-2013) - I thought the crew of [Blindsight](http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) was very well thought out and understandable in the human sense, only to find out that the author had gotten feedback about how un-cuddly they were. [That's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)) another very interesting piece of non-hand-wavium sci-fi that I can recommend, by the way. Easily the best vampire story I've ever read.

3 - <a name="foot-Thu-Jul-18-195055EDT-2013"></a>[|back|](#note-Thu-Jul-18-195055EDT-2013) - Or at least post-humans.
