I've managed to upload the first two videos from the first [Toronto FBP Group](https://bentomiso.com/events/fbp-meetup-nov) Meeting to [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user22632094/videos).

First, here's [Paul Tarvydas giving a brief introduction to FBP](https://vimeo.com/79320781). If you're a programmer that's never really heard of Flow Based Programming before, it's a pretty good start.

Second, here's [J. Paul Morrison talking about the history of FBP](https://vimeo.com/79329015). He's the guy who first discovered the idea, and formalized it while he was working at IBM in the early 1970s, and he talks a bit about what led to the insight. Near the end, he also demos a visual editor he's currently working on.

Sadly, because of the Vimeo basic account limitations, the JP Morrison video has a pretty crappy resolution, and my quick demo talk about a noflo webserver won't be uploaded until next week.

If you really just want the audio and slides, you can get the relevant files right [here](http://173.255.226.138/Toronto%20FBP%20Group/meeting-1/). You can probably get about 60% of the gist from the audio, but all three of us used some relevant visuals in our presentations. In the case of Paul T. and Paul M., a powerpoint presentation, and in my case some noflo code. I'll try to put up `.torrent` links for the HD versions of the videos when I figure out the logistics, and the third video will go up next Tuesday.

There were no videos from the second meetup<a name="note-Wed-Nov-13-164000EST-2013"></a>[|1|](#foot-Wed-Nov-13-164000EST-2013), and there won't be any from today<a name="note-Wed-Nov-13-164003EST-2013"></a>[|2|](#foot-Wed-Nov-13-164003EST-2013). We're basically trying to figure out how to pay for them; one idea I'm looking into is getting a monthly kickstarter going to let the market decide if there's enough interest to produce videos for a given month. I'm not sure how much advance notice we'll need, or how far we can actually plan out talks, but I'll keep you posted.

> EDIT:
> Torrents are now [up along with the audio and presentation materials](http://173.255.226.138/Toronto%20FBP%20Group/meeting-1/). If you do end up downloading these, please seed as long as you can.
