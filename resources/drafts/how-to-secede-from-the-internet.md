So lets sit down and seriously think through this crazy idea. Suppose you're a group of humans that would like to socialize amongst themselves pseudonymously without the various surveillance alphabet soups assing it up for you. What can you do, given that the existing internet is [mostly American](TODO) and therefore the target of some pretty serious anti-privacy shenanigans?

If your goal is merely to communicate with each other, it's not too hard to set up local network clusters that communicate with each other securely. [Tor](TODO) helps with that, and so does [GPG](TODO). However, most people on the internet have specific sub-goals. They like to [use](TODO twitter) their [favorite](TODO facebook) social [networks](TODO reddit), whichever [those](TODO 4chan) happen [to](TODO instagram) be, in [whatever](TODO YouTube) media.
