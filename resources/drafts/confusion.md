This has been the most utterly confusing pair of weeks I've had in a while. This is a journal piece; I might touch on something I was planning to work on, but will mostly deal with my mental garbage and internal state. You have been warned.

So last Thursday, I got let go from my position at [500px](TODO)[^out-of-date-team]. Judging by the reaction of the humans I was in contact with that day, I'm guessing they were expecting me to be more upset by this than I was. Granted, being let go is never a stress-free ordeal, and I'm still mildly concerned about the effect it would have on my long-term employability, but

1. the actions of the surrounding humans made it clear that there was no ill-will, in this and they were doing their best to make the situation equitable
2. I was already contemplating a change of scenery

[^out-of-date-team]: I'm not holding my breath to be off of [their team page](TODO) any time soon, because it was _well_ out of date, even before the events of last week.

The reason I was planning to quit is that it had been a damn long while since I did any fun work _at_ work, and I was getting that late-stage ILR feeling where I wondered briefly each morning whether to punch my reflection in the jaw on my way out. My new fitness regimen and some non-programming-related extra-curriculars were keeping my mood artificially high, but the lack of any real crunchy coding problems was starting to severely weigh on me. Like [last time](TODO - moneris), I didn't particularly have anything definite lined up, I just knew that staying were I was would eventually kill me. Anyway, as a result of this, the immediate net effect of me getting laid off was getting some extra free time.

Ostensibly, I mean. This morning, I talked to a couple friends that had been trying to hire me, and walked out to Mazouka with a couple offers that I very seriously wasn't expecting. Now my biggest problem is figuring out how to budget my suddenly _very_ scarce free time.

You might have noticed a few commits to [cl-notebook](TODO) recently. This was meant to be the leading edge of a moderate refactoring of the cell and export infrastructure, followed by a serious look at the current implementation of [cl-wolf](TODO) in order to integrate diagrammatic programming. I'm honestly not sure where that's going to go at this point. Given that my first choice of next place is going to be a very intense style of programming, I expect to be intellectually drained enough that I just barely
