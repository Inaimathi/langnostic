## About Me

I'm a "Graphic Designer" (graduated from [OCAD](http://www.ocadu.ca/) with a bachelor's) specializing in illustration and web development. Also, I like programming, and learning languages. Which is why I'm here.

Currently, I'm working as a Ruby/Go developer as part of [500px](https://500px.com).

## About This Site

This site was built out of `IO` and higher-order functions. The site itself is just under 500 lines of relatively readable Haskell, which I still plan to refine over the course of a few weeks or months. There's still no database _(Though I'm tempted to bust out [`acidstate`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/acid-state))_; just some [`markdown`](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [`JSON`](http://www.json.org/) being processed by [`pandoc`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc), [`aeson`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) and [`blaze`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html), then served up by [`Spock`](https://www.spock.li/)/[`wai`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai).
