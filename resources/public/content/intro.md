Welcome to Language Agnostic, the blog of [Inaimathi](https://github.com/Inaimathi)! It's now built on top of the [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) framework [`http-kit`](http://www.http-kit.org/). I'm reasonably confident it's no longer the _least_ performant blog on the internet.

Enjoy the various programming-themed writings availble on offer. The latest post is available below and the archive link is directly above this text.
