# TipJar

So. You've read a bunch of my crazy-ass ramblings, and you feel a compulsion to throw spare change at me.

Well, don't worry about it.

I'm a freelancing Toronto programmer, whose writing is crafted for the dual purposes of a log stream and my own amusement. You've paid me quite enough by reading. If that's really not good enough, and you feel the need to engage in reciprocation...

### Discuss

Submit my posts to the appropriate content aggregators and comment on them. I won't tell you which posts or aggregators, but pick out whatever you find interesting enough to discuss and discuss it. I wouldn't mind being poked, just so I can answer questions if they come up.

### Tip these folks

The [EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate), the [FSF](https://my.fsf.org/donate/), and [a choice piece of Lisp infrastructure](https://www.quicklisp.org/donations.html) all do good, necessary work, _and_ could probably put your money to better use than I would.

### Feed My Habits

I use some services that provide subscription bonuses.

Specifically, [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=445ca16e1a76), [Ritual](http://invite.ritual.co/LEO4857), [AirBnB](www.airbnb.ca/c/leoz1320) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/?exp=hp-c). So if you're considering signing up for any of them, click [here](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=445ca16e1a76) for DO, [here](http://invite.ritual.co/LEO4857) here for Ritual, [here](www.airbnb.ca/c/leoz1320) for AirBnB, or use the Uber invite code `leoz602ue` to give both of us a free kick in the appropriate service.

### Hire Me

If you've got the need for a programmer for a 5-to-30-hour-long project, are fine with it being built in some Lisp or ML flavor, think [I might be able to handle the challenge](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/inaimathi), and can pay my hourly rate, get in touch with me and give me something interesting to hack on.
