###### The personal blog of Inaimathi

- Currently written in [Go](http://golang.org/)
- Serves posts from the .md files found in [posts/](https://github.com/Inaimathi/langnostic/tree/master/posts/), so you could theoretically just read it from this repo (but it seems like it would be a pain in the ass to figure out which post is supposed to be the latest)

## ToDo

- `BGG Data Sifting`, `cl-notebook Thoughts` and `cl-notebook introductory thoughts` all have issues with the translation-from-markdown approach. Figure out what to do about this (also, `cl-notebook` obviously needs an export-to-markdown feature)
- Go through the archives and deal with any images you've got lying around
